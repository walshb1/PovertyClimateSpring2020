Hi Mook et al. 

Hereby the results for drought. Like in the paper I used a factor delta approach to bias correct for the GCM uncertainty (I looked at the factor increase between historical GCM runs and future ones (2030,2080) and superimposed this factor increase on top of the EUWATCH results).  

Since drought is a measure for variability rather than an indicator for absolute scarcity it might happen that for some countries –counterintuitively- the flood numbers are higher that the drought ones: for Egypt for example. This is one of the well-known drawbacks of such drought indices.
