Global Environmental Change


We produced coastal flood zone maps using sea level data from
the DIVA model (Vafeidis et al., 2008) and a digital elevation model
(DEM). The DIVA model provides expected surge heights for a 100
year return period for over 5000 different coastal segments, and
has been used as a tool for risk assessment on a European scale (e.g.
Hinkel et al., 2010). We then defined flood prone zones as coastal
areas with an elevation less than the 100 year surge height, and
with a direct connection to the sea. The elevation model used is the
near-global SRTM DEM, with a horizontal resolution of 300  300 (ca.
90 m  90 m at the equator) (Jarvis et al., 2008). Where these data
are not available (above 60 degrees north and below 60 degrees
south, which includes parts of Scandinavia, northern Canada,
Alaska and northern Russia), the GTOPO30 DEM is used (USGS,
1996). The GTOPO30 has a horizontal resolution of 3000  3000 (ca.
1 km  1 km at the equator).

For both coastal and river flood areas we assumed that the
hazard area remains constant over time, which means that the
areas exposed to a 1/100 year flood in 1970 are the same as those
exposed in 2050 (i.e. we do not account for climate change and/or
land subsidence). Given that climate change might have a
significant effect on the frequency and severity of future flood
events, this assumption could lead to an underestimation of future
flood prone areas. Also, like with the river flood extents, we did not
include the influence of flood defences in the analysis, which leads
to an overestimation of flood plains in areas where coastal flood
protection is in place.
